## Text To Coherent Image Generation 
1. Consistent self-attention for character-consistent image generation over long-range sequences. For the current implementation, the user needs to provide at least 3 text prompts for the consistent self-attention module. We recommend at least 5 - 6 text prompts for better layout arrangement.
